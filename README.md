024 The program that performs the following routine on the number: Arrange the digits in descending order and in ascending order (adding zeroes to fit it to a 4-digit number), and subtract the smaller number from the bigger number. Then repeat the previous step. Performing this routine will always cause you to reach a fixed number: 6174. Then performing the routine on 6174 will always give you 6174 (7641 - 1467 = 6174). Your program should return the number of times this routine must be performed until 6174 is reached. For example: if num is 3524 your program should return 3 because of the following steps: (1) 5432 - 2345 = 3087, (2) 8730 - 0378 = 8352, (3) 8532 - 2358 = 6174.
